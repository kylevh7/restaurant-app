Thank you for reviewing my Restaurant Review app. Please be aware of the following dependancies:

In order to view this web app and all of it's features such as locations on the map, and loading content once the page has been visited using service
workers you will have to use a localhost environment. 
	-I recommend using atom-live-server in the Atom development environment and opening the project on port 8000
	-Pleae download or clone all the files in this repository and run your local host environment from the folder containing these files. 



*Please note*
	The I implemented the service worker by using a technique that caches the portions of the site you have previously visited. Meaning that the full 
site will not load offline until you have visited the site online and the contents are cached. I chose this method to not give a false sense of internet connectivity
When trying to visit the site for the first time. 

Enjoy!
